Kartu was a passion project derived from the community service goals of a group of my friends in my late junior year of high school. The website was submitted to the Congressional App Challenge in November of 2022, where I developed my skills in React and Bootstrap web development. This repository serves as a temporary archive for the project until its possible revival. If you have any questions regarding the project or inquiries as to its continuance, feel free to reach out via the contacts provided via my profile.
